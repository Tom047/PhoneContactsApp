This is a phone book app. It allows you to add/delete/edit contacts from the database (SQL).

In the database "project" a table "contacts" should be created with the following columns:
1. id (data type: serial, not null, primary key)
2. name (data type: text, not null)
3. phone (data type: text, not null)
4. email (data type: text)

This application uses the libphonenumber library from Google. The archive is attached.
